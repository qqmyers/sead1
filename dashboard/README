=== projectsummary ===
It is a web application to summarize and display the important features of a SEAD project. Each SEAD instance will 
have its own summary page so it needs to be installed and deployed separately.

=== deployment instructions ===
--Change the domain and project path properties in nced.properties file
--Run the ant script to create the war file 
--Run deploy.sh script to deploy the project in tomcat.
--Project can be accessed at {server-name}/summary
	
===future work ===
-- Link google map with collection grid
-- Change logic to fetch root collections, currently it looks for <tagURI dcterms:creator creator name:vivolink> triple
-- Create the vivo links for sead users not just authors
